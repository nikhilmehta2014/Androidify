     * This code does the same thing, waiting one second before showing a snackbar. However, there are some important differences:
     * 1. [launch](https://kotlin.github.io/kotlinx.coroutines/kotlinx-coroutines-core/kotlinx.coroutines/launch.html) will start a coroutine in the [viewModelScope].
     * This means when the job that we passed to [viewModelScope] gets canceled, all coroutines in this job/scope will be cancelled.
     * If the user left the Activity before [delay] returned, this coroutine will automatically be cancelled when
     * [onCleared] is called upon destruction of the ViewModel.
     * 2. Since [viewModelScope] has a default dispatcher of [Dispatchers.Main], this coroutine will be launched in the main thread.
     * 3. The function [delay] is a [suspend] function.
     * This is shown in Android Studio by the  icon in the left gutter.
     * Even though this coroutine runs on the main thread, delay won't block the thread for one second.
     * Instead, the dispatcher will schedule the coroutine to resume in one second at the next statement.

    /** This function is called every time the user clicks on the screen â€“ and
     * it will cause the repository to refresh the title and write the new title to the database.
     *
     * This implementation uses a callback to do a few things:
     * - Before it starts a query, it displays a loading spinner with `_spinner.value = true`
     * - When it gets a result, it clears the loading spinner with `_spinner.value = false`
     * - If it gets an error, it tells a snackbar to display and clears the spinner
     *
     * Note that the `onCompleted` callback is not passed the `title`.
     * Since we write all titles to the `Room` database, the UI updates to the current title by observing a `LiveData` that's updated by `Room`.
     *
     * In the update to coroutines, we'll keep the exact same behavior.
     * It's a **good pattern** to use an observable data source like a `Room` database to automatically keep the UI up to date.
